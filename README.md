# Focus
Mattias Petersson, 2019

Focus is a structured improvisation piece for ensemble, composed for the Royal Live Electronics Ensemble at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm.

## Playing
Run the following line to start:

```f = Focus();```

This opens a new window with a blank card.

- Now pick an arbitrary (or agreed upon) start sound.
- Press space and follow the fade in of the card.
- When the card displays a word, focus on that musical quality and adjust your playing accordingly.
- The piece ends with the card going blank.
